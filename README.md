# Lyon_VDF

This repository provides a structured setup for configuring a pom.xml file and integrating a VDF (Volume-Delay Function) module. It enables the generation of a .jar file based on a custom lyon_config, allowing users to run MATSim simulations with VDF support tailored to the Lyon metropolitan area.
